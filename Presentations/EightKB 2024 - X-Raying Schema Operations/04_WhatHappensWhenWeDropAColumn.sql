/**********************************************************************************************************************
	Dropping a column is a metadata/logical operation not a physical one.
	We need to rebuild the table to reclaim the space.

	Note/curiosity: 
		When it is a record that is deleted, the data isn't removed/overwritten by the delete action (record is marked
		as GHOST_DATA_RECORD).
		
		Paul Randal mentions here (https://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/inside-the-storage-engine-anatomy-of-a-page/):
			“the cost of that will be deferred for the inserters and not for the deleters”.

	EASY RIGHT?!

	In this case yes!

	But let's stop and think a bit about this before running it:
		- Does this means I need to plan downtime? ("it depends")
		- Standard vs Enterprise

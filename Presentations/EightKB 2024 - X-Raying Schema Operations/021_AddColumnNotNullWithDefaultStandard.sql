	Be sure you want to add it this way due to locking (offline operation)

	An alternative way (also used before 2012 - even for Enterprise) is:
		- add the column allowing nulls
		- update the records to a desired value in batches (minimize locking)
		- change the column to NOT NULL and add the default constraint
